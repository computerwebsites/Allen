            <p>Dirk Nowitzki, (born June 19, 1978, Würzburg, West Germany), German professional basketball player who is regarded as one of the greatest foreign-born players in National Basketball Association (NBA) history.

Nowitzki took up basketball relatively late in life, at age 13. His immense natural talent (his mother was a member of the West German national basketball team) helped him quickly acclimate to the sport, and by age 16 he was playing with DJK Würzburg, a second-division German professional team. He first came to the attention of NBA scouts in 1998, when he scored 33 points to lead a team of international players age 19 and under to an upset victory over a collection of American high school stars in an exhibition game in San Antonio, Texas. As a result of the exhibition, he garnered dozens of scholarship offers to play collegiately in the United States, but Nowitzki instead declared his eligibility for the NBA draft. He was selected by the Milwaukee Bucks with the ninth overall selection of the 1998 NBA draft but was immediately traded to the Dallas Mavericks.</p>

            <p>Wardell Stephen Curry II (born March 14, 1988), better known as Stephen Curry, is a professional American basketball player with the Golden State Warriors. The son of former NBA player Dell Curry, Stephen first garnered national attention for his impressive play at Davidson College. He was drafted in 2009 by Golden State and eventually developed into one of pro basketball's top players with his stellar shooting skills. After garnering Most Valuable Player honors and helping the Warriors win the NBA championship in 2015, Curry led the team to a league-record 73 wins the following season. In May 2016, Curry became the first person to be named MVP by unanimous vote in NBA history, and one of only 11 players to win the MVP award two years in a row. He then helped the Warriors win the NBA title again in 2017 and '18, both times over the Cleveland Cavaliers.</p>
